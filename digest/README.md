# Digest

Digest project is going to be a tool for collecting important news and blog posts from selected bloggers

## MVP

Collect posts from selected substacks, summarize, collect to markdown file

## Next steps

- [x] remove images and links from post body (maybe need just plain text from html)
- [x] format summary with mock summary function
- [x] issue markdown version of digest
- [ ] multi source version with post iterator


## Ideas

Config file with specified sources. For each source you specify regex for title, that will be used to filter posts, can construct regex including and excluding specific terms. For each source specify name, that will be displayed as subsection in digest.
